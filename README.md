Generated with: Versatile Huff Project Template using Foundry.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

The following will need to be installed in order to use this template. Please follow the links and instructions.

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
  - You'll know you've done it right if you can run `git --version`
- [Foundry / Foundryup](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry)
  - This will install `forge`, `cast`, and `anvil`
  - You can test you've installed them right by running `forge --version` and get an output like: `forge 0.2.0 (f016135 2022-07-04T00:15:02.930499Z)`
  - To get the latest of each, just run `foundryup`
- [Huff Compiler](https://docs.huff.sh/get-started/installing/)
  - You'll know you've done it right if you can run `huffc --version` and get an output like: `huffc 0.2.0`
